# License

![CSL: Software Against Climate Change](https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?label=CSL&message=software%20against%20climate%20change&color=green?style=flat&logo=github)

Lunetten is licensed under the [Climate Strike
License](https://climatestrike.software/), which is a software license which
prohibits the use of its (source) code by applications and organizations that
depend on fossil fuel exploitation as their primary source of revenue.

## Rationale

Open source technology is becoming increasingly useful for Big Oil's
acceleration on fossil fuel extraction. With this license, this development
could be slowed down.  Although this license does not respect the rationale of
free nor open source software, we feel that is impossible for tech to be purely
apolitical and acknowledge our role as tech specialists in global society.  In
combination with the urgency of the matter, we believe that taking action is
the right thing to do.
